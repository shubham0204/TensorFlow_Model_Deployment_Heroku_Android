# Deploying TF models on Heroku for Android applications

The repository contains an Android as well as a Python project which can be used to deploy and use a TF model on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/platform). We're using the age detection model from [Age-Gender_Estimation_TF-Android](https://github.com/shubham0204/Age-Gender_Estimation_TF-Android) repo and then deploying it on Heroku with the help of [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/).
